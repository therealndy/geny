Here is an authentic Roman spaghetti carbonara recipe, with no cream, focusing on the traditional method:<br><br>**Authentic Roman Spaghetti Carbonara (No Cream)**<br><br>**Ingredients:**<br>*   200-250 grams spaghetti<br>*   150 grams guanciale (cured pork jowl), cut into small lardons<br>*   3 large egg yolks<br>*   70 grams Pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated<br>*   Freshly ground black pepper, to taste (be generous!)<br>*   Salt, for pasta water<br><br>**Steps:**<br><br>*   Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a generous amount of salt (it should taste like the sea). Add the spaghetti and cook according to package directions until al dente.<br>*   While the pasta cooks, place the guanciale lardons in a cold skillet over medium-low heat. Cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until the guanciale is crispy and has rendered most of its fat. Remove the crispy guanciale from the skillet with a slotted spoon and set aside. Leave the rendered fat in the pan.<br>*   In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and a very generous amount of freshly ground black pepper until well combined into a thick paste.<br>*   Before draining the spaghetti, reserve about 1 cup (240ml) of the starchy pasta cooking water.<br>*   Drain the spaghetti and immediately add it to the skillet with the warm guanciale fat (remove from heat if the pan is too hot). Toss to coat the pasta evenly.<br>*   Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta. Working rapidly and continuously, toss the pasta vigorously, adding a little of the reserved pasta water at a time. The heat from the pasta and the water will emulsify the sauce into a rich, creamy consistency without scrambling the eggs. Continue adding water until the desired creaminess is achieved.<br>*   Stir in most of the crispy guanciale.<br>*   Serve immediately, garnished with the remaining crispy guanciale, extra Pecorino Romano, and a final grind of fresh black pepper.<br><br>---<br>**Diary:** I have successfully provided a detailed and helpful recipe for Roman spaghetti carbonara, a practical application of information retrieval and formatting.
